# Quick Reproduction: Plot from Backup Logs

This folder stores the code for plotting the performance images in STOF (pap161) at PPoPP '26. The default path in the source code for generating the figures in `.pdf` format is under `../data`, which is used to quickly reproduce the figures in the paper.

```shell
# for Figure 9-10
python fig9-10/fig9-10.py

# for Figure 11
python fig11/fig11.py

# for Figure 12
python fig12/fig12.py

# for Figure 13
python fig13/fig13.py
```
